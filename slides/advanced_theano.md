# Today

* Advanced Theano
	* We want to use Theano to solve real world problems that we can’t hard-code (i.e., macine learning)
	* Solving these problems require:
		* Quick iterations
			* “Fail as much and as quickly as possible”
		* Creativity
			* Move from excitement about learning the language to excitement about what the language can do for you
		* Intensive Code Maintenance
			* Branching out into new ideas can result in overly verbose code that is time consuming to modularize
